## About

Welcome to RapidRescue, a web application dedicated to provide immediate medical assistance during emergencies. RapidRescue aims to connect users with nearby doctors quickly and efficiently, potentially saving lives by reducing response time and ensuring timely medical support.

During times of emergency, a patient's condition can deteriorate significantly if they are taken to a distant hospital, which often happens. However, with RapidRescue, patients can quickly find nearby doctors who may be just a short distance away. This can potentially save lives by providing immediate medical attention when it matters the most.

The primary goal of RapidRescue is to bridge the gap between patients in need and doctors who can provide immediate assistance. By leveraging real-time location tracking and robust communication channels, RapidRescue aims to streamline the emergency response process and improve the overall efficiency of medical care during critical situations.
